It's day time now, like 1PM.
I'm making the landing page.
It takes a bit of inspiration from [ladyada's website](https://www.ladyada.net/).

It's early in the morning, or maybe late at night idk. It's 12am ok.
I had to migrate from Postgres to Mongo because I realized my data doesn't fit in a relational DB.
Out of laziness, I almost stored my data as JSON strings in Postgres but that's just idiotic.
