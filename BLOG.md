### 2/6

I've been implementing things that I've been learning.
I'm now using the Context API and Reducer API as a substitute for global state mangement.
I was also able to reduce a lot of boiler plate code by using a reducer for the random generator controls.
Not sure where I'll go with that though because it is laggier than using individual state variables.
I also saw a really clever way of defining all API reqeuest functions in a seperate file.
It looks clean and gets rid of more boiler plate when creating requests.
I used to think (like a week ago) that more verbose code is better because I can really see what's going on.
But honestly, abstractions are great and reducing boilerplate code allows me to work faster.

It's day time now, like 1PM.
I'm making the landing page.
It takes a bit of inspiration from [ladyada's website](https://www.ladyada.net/).

### 2/1

It's early in the morning, or maybe late at night idk. It's 12am ok.
I had to migrate from Postgres to Mongo because I realized my data doesn't fit in a relational DB.
Out of laziness, I almost stored my data as JSON strings in Postgres but that's just idiotic.
